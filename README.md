# Server-Application-Basics
This is an implementation of socket programming using Python socket library. The code illustrates the basics of server-client application connection(TCP) based on IP address and Com Ports. The server.py file creates a socket and binds it, to an IP address (Local host in this case) and COM Port. If you run the two files beginning with the server.py file, there will be a connection, ready to send data.
